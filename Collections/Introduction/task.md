## Introduction

This section was inspired by [GS Collections Kata](https://github.com/goldmansachs/gs-collections-kata).

Kotlin can be easily mixed with Java code.
Default collections in Kotlin are all Java collections under the hood.

The [Kotlin standard library](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/)
contains lots of extension functions that make working with collections more convenient.
For example, operations that transform a collection into another one, starting with 'to':
[`toSet`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/to-set.html) or
[`toList`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/to-list.html).

Complete the code to fulfill:
1. empty customer List
2. map vararg to List
3. map List to Set
