## Data class copy

[Copy](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html#copying) is used to clone a data class. The copied object is a different instance but has the same attribute values unless explicitly changed.

Try to modify the function, so it will return a Person object with same name, but the age is a year older.
